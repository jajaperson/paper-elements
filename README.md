# paper-elements

The paper elements are a set of UI components designed to implement Google's [material design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) guidelines.

## Roadmap

### Current Priorities

With the `paper-elements` we're focusing on providing the highest-quality and most resilient set of material design components on the web. We won't be publishing brand-new elements as part of the set of the time being - for more material design-based web components, see the [webcomponents](https://www.webcomponents.org/search/paper) element catalog.

* Respond to and fix issues that come up with elements.
* Continually performance of elements, creating "light" versions of elements where needed.

### Coming Soon

* Design for what a "2.0" version of this element set might look like.
